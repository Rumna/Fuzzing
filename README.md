# Fuzzing
Survey on fuzzing techniques for software testing

# Overview
Fuzzing in software testing has provided a new direction in finding vulnerabilities in the program. It has become quite popular due to its simplicity and less overhead in deployment and its efficiency in finding real-world software bugs. In this project we did a survey on the exisiting techniques of fuzzing that is used to ensure software quality and software reliability.
